*Because every project needs a logo, right? (Pretend that link works.)*

## Description

URL shorteners that suck? Nope, not here. TinyTag is your snarky savior—shorten URLs, crank out QR codes, and pretend you’re a tech genius. Built with React and Firebase, it’s fast, permanent, and actually does what it says. Oh, and the **landing page**? A masterpiece. The **hero section**? So epic it might just save the day. Check it out [live](https://www.tinytag.xyz/) and try not to faint from the brilliance.

## Features

- **URL Shortening**: Turn monstrous URLs into tiny, smug little gems. Custom aliases included—because random strings are for losers.
- **QR Code Generation**: QR codes so pretty you’ll want to frame them. Customize with colors, logos, whatever vibe you’re feeling.
- **Live Analytics**: Spy on your link clicks like a pro. Who, where, when—get nosy in real-time.
- **Permanent Links**: These bad boys stick around forever. No disappearing acts, just speedy reliability.
- **Local Storage (No Login)**: Nope, no login nonsense here. Your links and stats are stashed in your browser’s local storage. That means editing, deleting, or drooling over analytics only works on the same browser and system you used to create them. Switch devices? Tough luck—your TinyTag life doesn’t follow you. Yet.
- **React + Firebase**: Slick UI meets backend sorcery. It’s a match made in tech heaven.

## Usage

1. Hit up the [live demo](https://www.tinytag.xyz/).
2. Shorten a URL or make a QR code. It’s so easy, even *you* can’t mess it up.
3. Customize it—colors, logos, aliases. Go wild.
4. Share it. Feel smug. Do it again.

**Heads-Up**: Since it’s all local storage, don’t nuke your browser data unless you’re cool with waving goodbye to your links. Your call.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For a UI smoother than your best pickup line.
- **Firebase**: Backend brilliance, no capes required.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The classics, with a twist of TinyTag flair.
- **Sarcasm**: The glue that keeps this project from taking itself too seriously.

## Known Issues

- QR codes so stunning, people forget to scan them.
- Analytics might turn you into a click-obsessed hermit. Chill out.
- Local storage ties you to one browser/system. Leave your laptop, lose your links. (We’re plotting a fix.)

---

## Future Plans

World takeover’s brewing, but first:
- More customization options (because logos are just the start).
- Deeper analytics (for the data freaks).
- Login feature (so your links can stalk you across devices).

Hang tight—or jump in and help.
